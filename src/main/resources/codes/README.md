These files are lists of game codes which make up meaningful words, names, acronyms, etc...

The file types are:
* acronym.txt - Popular Acronyms
* names.txt - Human Names
* other.txt - Words or names that don't make it into other lists
* prof. anity.txt - Words that may offend someone or may not be suitable for Twitch/Youtube. This is also useful to prevent accidentally generating a profanity.
* ultrabanned.txt - Words that should never be an option to allow. I'd like council on how to determine between regular banned words and never words.
* words.txt - General Words List
